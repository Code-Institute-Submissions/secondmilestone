# Cat-Matched
## A Card Matching Game for adults who like cats, a quick laugh and relaxation.

Cat-Matched is an easy to use, intuitive card-matching memory game aimed at older adults with minimal IT skills who like cats and want something easy and functional to play with. The game can also be enjoyed by younger adults who like cats and are looking for a quick, easy-to-play game that requires minimum skill and will break through the mundanity of their every-day lives.

#### *Project Goals*

The goal of Cat-Matched is to be a quick and relaxing break in an otherwise boring or stressful day. The game should feel like an escape. The target audience is older adults and young professionals.

**Player Goals**

The main audience for this game is older adults who like cats with minimum IT skills who want something which is easy to understand and navigate.

* To relax and decompress.
* To have a sense of achievement.
* To play something easy and funny.
* Playing something that is functional and simple. No complex rules or navigation, or good IT skills needed.
* To have a clear goal, which is quick and easy to achieve.
* To be visually stimulated.

These goals were addressed in the following way:

* Cat-Matched has a relaxing visual interface. The background picture, colour scheme and layout inspire a relaxing, calming feeling.
* The rules of the game are simple and there are just the right amount of cards so that it's easy to win but not so easy that it gets boring. The Moves counter keeps track of the number of moves made, so the player can compare their score each time and challenge themselves if they'd like.
* There are three difficulty levels, so the player can increase or decrease cards depending on how much they'd like to be challenged.
* The game has a minimum amount of buttons and elements, all of which are laid out clearly. The navigation is simple, clear and intuitive and the rules for the game are clearly and succinctly laid out and accessible at all times, even during game-play.
* The cat-cards are cute and a little bit quirky. The game should have an element of being a bit funny and amusing, so humorous images of cat illustrations were meticulously selected in order to bring a smile to the player's face.
* The background and colour scheme of the game are visually appealing and clean in order to both relax and inspire the player. 


**Developer and Business Goals**

My goals as a developer are as follows:

* To build a project using clean and concise Vanilla Javascript, in order to familiarise myself with the basics of the language without frameworks.
* To have well thought out programming that anticipates a person's lack of IT trouble-shooting skills, as the target audience is senior citizens.
* To have a project that stands out both visually and functionally in my portfolio.
